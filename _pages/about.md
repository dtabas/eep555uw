This page contains links to all homework assignments and solutions as they are posted for [EE PMP 559: Data Science for Power Systems](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/teaching/EE559_2019). Homework assignments can be downloaded individually from [https://github.com/cpatdowling/ee559](https://github.com/cpatdowling/ee559) or they can pulled via a Git client. Git is a version control tool for software engineering, but is great for making your code available to a broader audience. If you've downloaded Git, to clone (initialize a repository and download) a repository from command line, say from your school directory for example:

`chase@mycomputer:~/school$ git clone https://github.com/cpatdowling/ee559.git`

When new assignments and solutions are released, all you need to do to update your repository is to use the 'pull' command inside the repository directory:

`chase@mycomputer:~/school/ee559$ git pull`

If you'd prefer to use a GUI, there is a [desktop GitHub client](https://desktop.github.com/) that makes cloning, pushing, and pulling repositories very straightforward.

Submit your these coding assignments along with the written portions to the Dropbox links provided with your name in the .ipynb filename.
