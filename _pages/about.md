This page contains links to all programming assignments and solutions as they are posted for [EE P 555: Data Science for Power Systems](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/teaching/EE555). The content was created by Chase Dowling for EE 559, Spring 2019 and modified by Daniel Tabas. 

Homework assignments can be downloaded individually from [https://github.com/dtabas/ee555](https://github.com/dtabas/ee555) or they can pulled via a Git client. Git is a version control tool for software engineering, but is great for making your code available to a broader audience. If you've downloaded Git, to clone (initialize a repository and download) a repository from command line, say from your school directory for example:

`name@mycomputer:~/school$ git clone https://github.com/dtabas/ee555.git`

When new assignments and solutions are released, all you need to do to update your repository is to use the 'pull' command inside the repository directory:

`name@mycomputer:~/school/ee555$ git pull`

If you'd prefer to use a GUI, there is a [desktop GitHub client](https://desktop.github.com/) that makes cloning, pushing, and pulling repositories very straightforward.

Submit your coding assignments along with the written portions to Canvas.
